Some very very old code i did (According to the last modification date of one compiled file in 2006).

The project is made with visual basic 6.0 and it's not too great anyway, but i was still learning back then.
I was experimenting with encryption and there is some pretty simple text encryption algorythm.

I'm publishing this in the hope that maybe it's of some help to someone learning to code or interested in the basics of encryption.

The encryption used was very simple and weak, i don't even remember or checked the code, but here it is for the internet to enjoy, improve or ignore.

I'm not going to give any support to this repo, but if anyone makes a pull request i might review it and merge it.

If there are any bugs (very probably there are) i won't be fixing them, if you can't make it compile, good luck, i wont help you, this project is here just for anyone curious, there's probably lots of bad practices and lots of spanish, be warned!

And remember!
# I was learning back when i did this!
